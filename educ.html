    <h1>Education Background</h1>
    <p>I went to School with the aim of gaining skills and knowledge to make me a better citizen<br> but unknowingly and fortunately, I am exceeding my expectation. I realised my writing skill<br> from Kololo SSS at my ordinary level where I did more of
        reading story books which improved<br> both my writing and reading skill.</p>
    <p>I currently go to <a href="https://www.mak.ac.ug/">Makerere University</a>and pursuing<br> a Bachelors in Software Engineering at <a href="https://cis.mak.ac.ug/">College Of Computing and<br> Information Sciences</a> where my greatest hope for becoming
        the greatest Software developer lies.</p>
